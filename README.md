# Internet-Speed-Test
Just a linux bash script for monitoring your internet speeds.
My ISP is notorious for dodgy internet speeds so I decided I needed proof to ensure I got what I paid for.
I wrote this short script to monitor my internet speeds using the speedtest-cli unix tool
Results are written to a file of your choice and test intervals are also determined at run time.
If you do not have the speed test cli intstalled on your linux system just type:
$user@localhost> sudo  apt-get install speedtest-cli
;)
